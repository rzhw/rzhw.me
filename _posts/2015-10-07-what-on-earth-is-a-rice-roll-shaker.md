title: What on earth is a rice roll shaker?
---

It might just be a rite of passage of becoming a true consumer when you start buying cheap but *supposedly* useful things on the grounds that they might even have a smidgeon of purpose to make some material benefit in your life.

In other words, I'm not sure what I've just done with $2.80[^conversion] of my money.

*Look at the happy sushi staring into your soul*

For the uninitiated, Daiso is a chain of stores packed with oodles and oodles of wonderful little things for everything in your life. Or *Everyday life solutions*, as their current Australian slogan proclaims, because you don't really have many alternatives when you've been saying *Everything two-dollars eighty* all the time and then start putting out signs on April 1st saying there'll be $3.80 and $4.80 products now as well[^aprilfools].

But it's okay, because they have dried mangoes.

*Who cares about finest quality you'll have to rip those delicious things out of my dead, sugary hands*

They're amazing.

I'm not here to tell you the glories of Daiso though, although maybe that was a neat side addition. Today I'm here [as promised]({% post_url 2015-10-05-how-does-blog %}), to talk about that rice roll shaker I bought from them. The lowdown: it's a little thing which you literally shake rice in... and you get rice rolls[^creative].

Starting off, we scoop in a bit of sushi rice, then drop in the filling. I went with a strip of cucumber. Dialing up the creativity to 11 here.

Following that, you pack in more rice... and then you shake. Thankfully, it feels like a solid piece of plastic for what it is.

At this point, regret hits me because I bought this thing knowing full well that we had a proper rice rolling mat at home. But hey, novelty, right?

The instructions on the back of the packaging say to shake it about 20-30 times. Now as someone who probably spends the majority of his time moving no muscles except the bare minimum required to sustain finger-to-keyboard movement, this is a pretty big ask.

Time for some arm exercise.

Once you're done, here's the fun part.

You can open it up to admire your hard workout's results, or alternatively, here's the fun part: grab a bit of sushi nori (seaweed), stick it into the slot, and then start the shaking process all over again.

And before you know it, your nori waves goodbye to what last freedom it had.

After you've given your arm the last workout it needed for a year again, flip the shaker open, and you've got your roll! Cut it up, and... here's the regret part.

Put another way, it's a lot easier and a lot more effective to make sushi pieces, by, well, rolling your sushi roll by hand.

*Results may vary[^resultsmayvary]*

Don't let that dissuade you from spending $2.80 of your hard earned dosh on a bright yellow and clear piece of plastic, though. Which happens to help you shake rice into a beautiful round form.

Because it's totally worth it for the arm workout.

And you can buy dried mangoes while you're at it.

  [^conversion]: Looking at how fantastic our conversion rates are at the moment, that's about $1.96 USD
  [^aprilfools]: I genuinely thought that was an April Fool's joke until I went in quite a few times later and saw $3.80 stickers everywhere
  [^creative]: Depending on your creativity you could achieve great things with this rice roll shaker but that's outside the realm of this discussion
  [^resultsmayvary]: I'm still not that great with knife skills at the moment, but I tried again afterwards with a sushi rolling mat. The pieces came out packed nicely, and could be cut both more easily and evenly
