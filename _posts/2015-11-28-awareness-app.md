There's way too many productivity apps or "methodologies" out there. The closest to one that I haven't dropped after a few days is [Awareness](http://iamfutureproof.com/tools/awareness/), for OS X 10.6 and up. I've had it on my Mac for probably around a year now.

The website looks a bit dated (kinda nostalgic, really), but it works pretty well on El Capitan. If you're a bit of a design nerd like me, don't worry because it's not hardcoded to use Lucida Grande or Helvetica.

In fact, it's got hardly any UI. Basically it starts a timer, then plays a sound--a Tibetan singing bowl--every hour. It'll stack up, so at two hours you'll hear it twice, and three hours thrice, and so on. And for the UI that does exist, it sticks the timer in your menu bar. If you stop using the computer for five minutes, it resets. Nice and subtle. That's pretty much it.

Sometimes I look at the timer or hear the bowl and realise I should definitely get up and take a break. Other times, like when I'm procrastinating at night for hours straight, or when I've convinced myself my thesis really needs some four hours straight loving, I ignore it. The latter was way more common when I felt pressured by uni work! Luckily it hasn't seen me through any all-nighters. Never pulled much of them.

There's also times when the sound goes off loudly around friends, or when I'm on Skype. They'll ask what it is, intrigued, and I'll tell them. Sometimes it'll be "Oh, that's cool", or "Oh, how come?".

Now that I'm on break, it's pretty good as just a timer for how long I've been using the computer for.

Solving the actual problem of being on the computer for too long seems to be a separate issue still, though. That's something else I can blog about. Awareness might alleviate it a bit, but as with anything else: it's not a silver bullet.

But hey, it's free, and being a subtle little thing definitely seems to have helped.
