title: Your thoughts sometimes need writing
---

Over the past years, a bright eyed hopeful me increased my web presence a bit,
and soon enough, a somewhat more tired and worn out me subsequently lowered it.

My problem with blogging has always been that it's been a time consuming and somewhat tiring task,
and I'd much rather be focusing on <del>procrastination</del> my studies, tinkering with side projects,
or various other hobbies to whittle away at my time.

Meanwhile, I've always been an avid reader of sites like Hacker News and /r/programming,
and the thought occasionally bubbles in my head about whether I should give blogging a better go.
*But,* the voice inside quivers, *I don't even know what to blog about! And everyone else is so good at it!*

Surely I'm not the only one who feels this way. So, what?

Huh.

A month or so ago, working on a project, I've thought about how my experiences with it were honestly
more than just the simple phrase "working on a project".
There's a string of amusing disappointments and wonderful achievements
that reveal themselves along the ride on almost any project you can engross yourself in, so why not keep track of them,
and be able to look back and go -- hey, I actually took away some pretty cool stuff from that?

So I opened Evernote, created a note, dated it, and let a jumble of thoughts flow.
Without worrying about how to write it, who it'd read by, organising it, or anything like that at all.
And hey, I'm not a master writer. I did horrifically in high school English.
But in what felt like little time, a paragraph or two would be done.

Every few days I worked on something, went out, or just flat out procrastinated, I'd essentially repeat the process.

What came out was pretty much just regular messy brainfarts, but reading through them, and seeing
things I've learned, incredibly hacky workarounds, feelings of success --
there's a great sense of accomplishment in seeing all of them.

If you're not much of a blogger (I mean, I'm not), you could give that method a simple try.
Every week or so, open some text editor, write the date, and just let some thoughts flow. They don't have to be coherent, cohesive, whatever --
even write in txtspeak, 13375p34k or pig latin if you want --
as long as you're honest with yourself about what you've done, what you've achieved, and what you absolutely, completely, utterly, royally screwed up.

You don't need to take the words along to the world outside.
Obviously not everything you do all the time is worth sharing,
otherwise scrolling through MyFaceWitterIneStagramPlus would be the most utterly mundane activity in the world.

But sometimes, at least you can look back at what you've done. Like a journal. Actually, that is a journal.
