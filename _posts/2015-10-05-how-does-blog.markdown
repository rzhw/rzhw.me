title: How Does Blog
---

Looks like it's been nearly two years since I last blogged here. That's crazy. So what gives?

If you knew much of me before, and the kind of stuff I used to consider blogging about, yeah, that's pretty much not the kind of thing you'd expect from me, right. Funny how time can change people.

(Spoiler alert: Sadly no, I haven't been keeping entries in Evernote these days, and I'd probably be cringing if I looked at the last time I did)

Anyway, it probably was a reason as dumb as a rice roll shaker to finally get me off my butt, and through the process of eventually landing onto something to *just write some damn text into*, and publishing into the whole wide world to see. (And maybe I'll look back in two years again and think "Wow, I did it again". Or maybe "Wow, I really did behave a lot differently then too hang on oh no the way the internet never forgets is going to make me regret everything I publ-")

Okay, it's 2015 on an unusually hot, spring day. So what do I want to blog about, and how?

### What to blog about

Well for starters, unless I was some famous personality, blurting personal walls of text probably won't be useful to anyone or anything except Archive.org (marginally) and to be saved permanently into Skynet's language sorting machine learning personality big data laa-dee-dah (can't wait).

Apart from the occasional *because I can* kind of post, which I can't guarantee not posting, I think my motivations are going to be kind of the same, and kind of different from when I used to blog. Which essentially means I just said absolutely nothing. Let's actually say something this time.

Just blogging about programming is restrictive. Like, why not rice roll shakers? It's a good subject for another post, but after a long childhood of computers and gadgets, some day I realised that I've been moving away from that. I still love computing, I don't reget studying computer science, and I definitely don't regret wanting to do programming from a pretty darn early age.

But the mix of what I want to do with my time shifted away from the computer. It's tiring on the eyes and mind to just sit there tapping away, whether that be on a keyboard, or a piece of glass[^glass]. So what I think I'll be blogging about is going to reflect that change.

It won't just be things I find cool, interesting, funny, sad or frustrating about computing, or computers. It'll be more. Like about rice roll shakers, and why $2.80 for a rice roll shaker might or might not be worth your time and investment, no matter whether you're a rice roll shaker connoisseur or not[^cantstop].

Now **don't get me wrong**, it's not a bad thing to have your energy entirely be around tech. It's just what I've decided to shift from. That's what I want to try and make this little corner of the internet be now[^corner].

Finally, let's talk about Twitter briefly before moving on. It's been mostly the only way I've been "blogging" at all in recent times, and it's helpful in a way, because it is so much more *effortless* than blogging in longform, something I've convinced myself I just don't have time for. So as a filler for all the times I don't longform blog, Twitter's been great.

Effortlessness is the key theme of what bugs me about blogging, which takes me to the next subject.

But before I do, have you been thinking about blogging, but haven't felt you've had the time for it? Try making a Twitter account. Or Tumblr. Instagram. Whatever. Something you feel can let you express something quickly and easily. That's my new advice for 2015. Not a text editor, but something natural[^natural]. When you think you're ready to take a step into a different kind of blogging, you'll have already taken so much more steps than you would've otherwise.

Onto the how.

### How I'm blogging

We'll just get it out of the way first: I'm not using a rice roll shaker to blog. They don't have enough electronics in them, and while they may certainly help make you a delicious shaken roll of rice, they don't have what it takes to take my text dumps and format them into beautiful, readable words.

So what am I using? Well, as much as I espoused the greatness of effortlessness, it's really an ideal. I'm pretty much sticking with my original, techy setup from 2013. While it's not the most "effortless", it's certainly simple, and much more distraction-free than a lot of the options out there.

In detail, that's [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), version 1.something[^jekyll2]. Hosting's also remaining with GitHub Pages, who've done a brilliant job of keeping my beautiful blank website alive. They'll do a good job with a little more content than that, I'm sure :)

Times have changed with text editors though[^texteditors], and my main drivers are now a mix of Atom and Vim. I'm using Atom to edit this post and preview it right now, and it's *just beautiful*.

And that's it!

I really did look at quite a few options out there, and wasted a whole bunch of time while I was at it[^worthit]. Names I've thought about included WordPress, Tumblr, Medium, Svbtle, Obtvse, Ghost, Anchor CMS, and of course, Jekyll. A nice full circle.

This is really a harder subject to make relevant for others, because what works for one obviously won't work for everyone. If you love Markdown and writing your thoughts out in a good text editor, and also don't mind a bit of hackery, I would definitely recommend the Jekyll setup to you. If not, depending on who you are, there's a huge range of options out there.

I do love finding evaluations others write of various tools and setups they use, so I'll definitely think about writing one about these blogging tools, and what you might want to pick.

### In closing

Something as dumb as a rice roll shaker really did get me off my butt, to write out a longform about what I want to blog about, and how. Even though it's incredibly stupid, if you're reading this, I hope you've gotten a takeaway or two if you've been thinking about picking up blogging again as well.

If we ever meet, and this is somehow one of the more memorable things I've written, screw beers, let's talk over a sushi roll ;)

  [^glass]: Wonder if that's a phrase I would've used in 2013. Or 2010. Or 2007, even?
  [^cantstop]: Can't stop won't stop (this is the point where I started thinking it would be funny to start inserting rice roll shakers into my serious walls of text after the fact)
  [^corner]: I suppose it's natural that as you change, the way you want to represent yourself will change.
  [^natural]: If you're a diehard or kinda diehard pre-social media user like me, I'm sure you might've twitched a bit reading that. Let's not start the debate about those kinds of services, because I do think they deserve at least the respect for being a stepping stone. It's like the whole theme of the new generation of computing being about making things accessible ;)
  [^jekyll2]: 2.0 came out after I stopped, and I'm not sure if I'm technically using 2.0 now, but I'm just picking up my blog's files from where I stopped
  [^texteditors]: Depending on who you are. You might still be using TextMate for all I know and loving it, and that's cool too.
  [^worthit]: #worthit
