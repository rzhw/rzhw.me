title: Always be iTunes carding
---

Ever since my iPhone 4, I blame Apple to have been the first major reason that's actually gotten me to happily fork out cash for apps. (Setting aside a few things, like Gabe Newell, being out of high school and in uni, and being able to get a rMBP to replace a creaky old Toshiba.) Well, happy enough when Apple isn't causing the [MASpocalypse](http://mjtsai.com/blog/2015/11/12/no-one-minding-the-store/).

Anyway, I've been doing some spring cleaning and *look what I found*:

![Stack of iTunes cards](/blog/images/itunes-cards-20151114.jpg)
*First thought: \*starts counting\* how on earth have I spent that much?!*

Let's see what that comes out to:

- 7 x $20 cards: $140 AUD
- 7 x $30 cards: $210 AUD
- 4 x $50 cards: $200 AUD
- *Total:* $550 AUD

Holy moly. Thankfully, they're *constantly* on sale. Huge props to whoever's behind and whoever contacts [Gift Cards on Sale](https://www.giftcardsonsale.com.au/), because I'm catching [20% off](https://www.giftcardsonsale.com.au/tag/20-off+itunes/) deals regularly thanks to them. There used to be [25% deals](https://www.giftcardsonsale.com.au/tag/25-off+itunes/) every now and then but they've dried up, though the elusive [50% off](https://www.giftcardsonsale.com.au/tag/50-off+itunes/) still rears its head every now and then.

With the first iTunes card I got, I decided to just keep them around. Good foresight, because that means I got to make this huge pile to just stare at in shock, years down the road! But at least they were on sale.

Moral of the story: **Always be iTunes carding.**

While I'm at it, I thought I'd look up everything I owned over $20 (and hope I wouldn't get too sad looking at the numbers):

- Sketch 2: $74.99 AUD
- Sketch 3: $64.99 AUD
- Fantastical 2: $49.99 AUD
- Pixelmator: $31.99 AUD
- AnkiMobile: $25.99 AUD
- Tweetbot for Mac: $24.99 AUD
- *Total:* $272.94 AUD

Okay, considering that Adobe is [a little bit out of range](http://prodesigntools.com/products/adobe-cs6-pricing-list.html) as a student, that total is really, really sweet. I felt a bit stung when Sketch 3 came out not long after I got myself Sketch 2, but it's great, and so is Pixelmator.
